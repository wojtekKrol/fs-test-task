# Recruitment Full Stack Test Task

Welcome to the Recruitment Full Stack Test Task! This task is designed to assess your skills in building a full-stack application where you'll create the backend using MongoDB as the database and connect it to the frontend located in the 'fe' folder of this repository.

## Task Description

Your challenge is to develop the backend using MongoDB as the database and establish a connection to the provided frontend. The frontend contains mock data, and your objective is to replace this mock data with actual data fetched from the backend.

### Backend Requirements:

1. **MongoDB Database**: Set up a MongoDB database to store product information.
2. **Express.js Server**: Create an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
3. **RESTful API**: Implement RESTful API endpoints to perform Read operation for products.
4. **Connect to Frontend**: Ensure that the frontend can make requests to the backend to fetch product data.
5. **Docker**: Optionally, you can containerize your backend application using Docker for easier deployment.
6. **Flexible Backend Structure**: You have the flexibility to structure the backend as you see fit. You can choose the folder structure, naming conventions.

### Frontend Requirements:

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Replace the mock product data in the frontend with real data fetched from the backend.
2. **Display Products**: Ensure that the frontend can display the list of products fetched from the backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with the task, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'fe' folder to access the frontend code.
3. Set up the backend using MongoDB as per the backend requirements mentioned above.
4. Replace the mock data in the frontend with data fetched from the backend.
5. Test the integration between the frontend and the backend to ensure proper communication.

## Submission

Once you have completed the task, please push your code to your own repository. Provide the repository link along with any necessary instructions or documentation for running the application.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**: Does the application meet the specified requirements?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
3. **Database Design**: Is the MongoDB database designed appropriately for storing product information?
4. **Integration**: Is there successful integration between the frontend and the backend?
5. **Error Handling**: Are errors handled gracefully, with appropriate error messages displayed to the user?
6. **Documentation**: Is there sufficient documentation provided to understand how the application works and how to run it?
